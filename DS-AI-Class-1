What is Datascience :
====================
Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting insights from data using a combination of statistical, computational, and domain-specific knowledge. 
It involves several steps and technologies:
  Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources such as databases, web scraping, and APIs.
  Data Cleaning: Preparing data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
  Data Exploration: Analyzing data patterns and distributions using visualization tools.
  Modeling: Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
  Evaluation: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
  Deployment: Integrating models into applications for real-time predictions.
Technologies Used in Data Science:
==================================
  Programming Languages: Python, R
  Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
  Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Spark, Hadoop
  Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
Examples:
========
  Predictive Analytics: Forecasting sales using historical data.
  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment analysis on social media posts.

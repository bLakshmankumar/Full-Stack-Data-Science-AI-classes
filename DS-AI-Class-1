Class -1 is a basics overview of the course details-concepts 

What is Datascience :
====================
Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting insights from data using a combination of statistical, computational, and domain-specific knowledge. 
It involves several steps and technologies:
--------------------------------------------
  Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources such as databases, web scraping, and APIs.
  Data Cleaning: Preparing data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
  Data Exploration: Analyzing data patterns and distributions using visualization tools.
  Modeling: Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
  Evaluation: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
  Deployment: Integrating models into applications for real-time predictions.
Technologies Used in Data Science:
==================================
  Programming Languages: Python,
  Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
  Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Spark, Hadoop
  Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
Examples:
========
  Predictive Analytics: Forecasting sales using historical data.
  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment analysis on social media posts.
  Computer Vision: Image recognition in autonomous vehicles.

Project Lifecycle for DataScience :
===================================
Step -1 : Understand the business problem
Step -2 : Gather the Data  : (By using "sql" queries we should retrive the data from storage)
Step -3 : Processing the Data (becuase gathered the data might be any format) : We can process the data by using "SQL (or) Python"
Step -4 : Analyse the Data : We have to analyse each and every column by using "Statistics".
Step -5 : Develop the Machine-Learning Algorithm (Once develop the Ml-algorithm we have to validate/evalute before giving it to Client). 
          We can develop model development by using Machine Learning(Banking), Deep Learning(Image anaytics), NLP(Natural language Processing)-(Text-analysis).
Step -6 : Evaluate the Model ( Here we will verify Metrics for calculate the model errors & etc)
Step -7 : Handover to Client (or) Model Deployment.

========================================================================================================================================================================================
Tools required for Data analysis :
===================================
 1) SQL  2) Python  3) Statistics  4) Visualization tools(Power-BI), Tableau). : If we learn these tools we will become a Data-Analyst/Business Anayst/Python Developer/ SQl Admin.

Tools Required for Data-Scientist :
====================================
1) SQL  2) Python  3) Statistics  4) Visualization tools(Power-BI), Tableau 5) ML 6) Deep Learning 7) NLP 8) Maths  : If we learn these tools we will become a Data-Scientist.

Deployemnt : 
=============
Once we develop the ML-Models where we have to deploy : We have to deploy on Cloud, Here we will teach you How to deploy these models on MLops(Machinlearning Operations) inside azure ML.


Class -2 :
===========
Some use cases of each technology :
===================================
 ML - Usecaase :
 ===============
   ML can be used for Stock-prediction, Loan predection, Forecasting.

 Deep Learning - usecases :
 ==========================
   DL can be used for Image analytics, Object detection, Video detection, Face detection.
   Image means using Deep learning algorithms

 NLP - Usecases :
 ================
    NLP cal be used for text analysis(Chat-bot), Review analysis, Spell correction, Document summery & etc.

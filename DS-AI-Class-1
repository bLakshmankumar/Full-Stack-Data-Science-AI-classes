Class -1 is a basics overview of the course details-concepts 

What is Datascience :
====================
Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting insights from data using a combination of statistical, computational, and domain-specific knowledge. 
It involves several steps and technologies:
--------------------------------------------
  Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources such as databases, web scraping, and APIs.
  Data Cleaning: Preparing data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
  Data Exploration: Analyzing data patterns and distributions using visualization tools.
  Modeling: Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
  Evaluation: Assessing model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
  Deployment: Integrating models into applications for real-time predictions.
Technologies Used in Data Science:
==================================
  Programming Languages: Python,
  Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
  Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Spark, Hadoop
  Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
Examples:
========
  Predictive Analytics: Forecasting sales using historical data.
  Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment analysis on social media posts.
  Computer Vision: Image recognition in autonomous vehicles.

Project Lifecycle for DataScience :
===================================
Step -1 : Understand the business problem
Step -2 : Gather the Data  : (By using "sql" queries we should retrive the data from storage)
Step -3 : Processing the Data (becuase gathered the data might be any format) : We can process the data by using "SQL (or) Python"
Step -4 : Analyse the Data : We have to analyse each and every column by using "Statistics".
Step -5 : Model Building   : Develop the Machine-Learning Algorithm (Once develop the Ml-algorithm we have to validate/evalute before giving it to Client)."ML/DL/NLP"
          We can develop model development by using Machine Learning(Banking), Deep Learning(Image anaytics), NLP(Natural language Processing)-(Text-analysis).
Step -6 : Evaluate the Model ( Here we will verify "Metrics" for calculate the model errors & etc)
Step -7 : Handover to Client (or) Model Deployment. - "Azure ML"

Deployemnt : 
=============
Once we develop the ML-Models where we have to deploy : We have to deploy on Cloud, Here we will teach you How to deploy these models on MLops(Machinlearning Operations) inside azure ML.

# Class - 3 :
=============
   Output colums have two types :
   1) Engilsh letters : Categorical data / Qualitative data
   2) Numbers         : Numerical Data / Quantitative data
 # What is ML ?
 ===============
   Understand the Past data,and make the predictions on your future data.

 Underthis ML we have different types :
 --------------------------------------
   1) Supervised learning : If a data has both input columns and output columns we can call it as Supervised learning.
        Based on output labels supervised learning devided into 2 algorytm types :
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------
         A) Classification Algorithms : Means Output label has Categorical/Qualitative data type
             Types in Classification Algorithms :
             ------------------------------------
               > Logistic Regression *
               > Decesion Tree
               > K-Nearest Nighbours
               > Native Bayes
               > Support Vector machines
               > Random Forest *
               > Boosting Algorithms
         B) Regression Algorithm      : Means Output label has Numerical/Quantitative data type
             Types in regression Algorithms :
             --------------------------------
               > Linear Regression
               > Lasso Regression
               > Ridge Regression
   
   2) Unsupervised Learning : If data has no output label and there is no specific target we can call it as Supervised learning.
       Unsupervised learning devided into 1 algorytm type :
       ----------------------------------------------------
           Cluster Algorithm : Cluster algorithms aim to discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data by grouping similar data points together. 
                               Imagine sorting a basket of fruits without labels – a cluster algorithm would put apples with apples and oranges with oranges.
           Example :  clothing store uses a cluster algorithm to analyze customer purchase history. It groups customers who buy similar clothes, helping personalize product recommendations.
        Two main types of clustering algorithms :
        -----------------------------------------
           1) K-Means CLuster Algorithms (Centroid-Based Clustering) : 
           2) Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms :

    3) Reinforcement Learning : Reinforcement learning is a type of AI where an agent learns through trial and error in an environment.
                                Imagine an agent playing a game, it receives rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones.
                                This is used for real-time tasks like training robots to navigate factories, optimizing traffic flow in cities, 
                                and even personalizing recommendations for users on streaming services.
      Technologies we use for Reinforcement Learning :
      ------------------------------------------------
         A) Deep Learning -------> Images
         B) NLP  --------> Text (chatbot)  
         C) AI Technologies 
    
Note : In ML how many algorithms we ahve to learn :
----------------------------------------------------
               1) Supervised Learning   : Classification (7) + Regression (3)
               2) UnSupervised Learning : Cluster Algorithms (2).
            Total : 12 Algorithms.
